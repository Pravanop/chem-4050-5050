The lj-potential and square well potential have the same trend </br>
with the virial coefficient increasing with temperature. 
However, the hard-sphere potential has a constant positive value, which indicates that it is not a good approximation.

The lj-potential shows a more realistic behavior with a positive value above room temperature and a negative value below room temperature.
